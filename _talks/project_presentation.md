After a successful completion of the course on [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) with [Dr. Chamberlain Mbah](https://chambox.github.io/) from the [Gent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) in Belgium we were presented with the classification problem of building a cnn model that predict whether a given image of a road has a pothole or not. The project was successfully completed alongside five colleagues of mine. I presented the findings and the outcomes of the results before the academic director, [Prof. Franck Kalala Mutombo](https://aims-senegal.org/person/prof-franck-kalala-mutombo/) of AIMS, tutors, the lecturer and the students. Here is a [link](https://github.com/IkeKobby/cnn_image_classification/blob/main/CNN_pothole_classification.ipynb) to the notebook for the project.
