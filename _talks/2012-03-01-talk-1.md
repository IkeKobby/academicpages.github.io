As part of my undergraduate degree programme, thus, BSc Financial Mathematics, it was required to write a thesis and justify the analyses and results before a panel of four members and colleagues of the graduating students. After presentation and question answering from both the panel and the students the justification was approved and hence an excellent reward for the thesis. I was awarded my certificate in November, 2019.
