This is one of my most recent research activities that hopefully would cullminate my masters in mathematical sciences at the AIMS Senegal Center. It is basically computational finance, I implement papers on structural models for measuring credit default and determing bankruptcy. This in intend gives me graphical knowledge and intepretation to these models where I derive the understanding for the write up. Final outcome of the resul shall be discussed accordingly.
