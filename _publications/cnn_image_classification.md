This is a computer vision project with image classification problem. We built a convolutional neural network for potholes and non-potholes classification. We used transfer learning, leveraging the EfficientNet architecture to improve the performance of our base model. The dataset used for this project is from the [Zindi Africa](https://zindi.africa/) website. There is more description of the project and the dataset [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/miia-pothole-image-classification-challenge).
