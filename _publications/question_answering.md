This is a mini project on question answering task using natural language processing techniques. The data used for the training is saved in [this github repository](https://github.com/IkeKobby/nlp_project/raw/main/used_data.zip). In this project of question answering we employed the method of text extraction to retrieve answers to a given question given the context from which the question was asked. The data used is a smaller portion of the [entire dataset](https://github.com/ndah-e/Natural-language-processing-course/blob/main/notebooks/data/fquad1.0.zip) with full description [here](https://fquad.illuin.tech/). Due to inadequate resources for training the model we resolved to a subset of the entire datase and utilised the Google provided GPU to aid with the training.
