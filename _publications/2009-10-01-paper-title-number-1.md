This notebook contains a part of a classification problem with diabete data. In this mini project we build deep learning neural network for classification problem with imbalance dataset. We had several preprocessing techniques to apply to meet the objectives of the project. The notebook does not contain information regarding the original work for confidentiality purposes. However, the steps and techniques used are all employed in this notebook.
