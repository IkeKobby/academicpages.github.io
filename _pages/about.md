I am Isaac Kobby Anni, a Ghanaian by birth and lover of table tennis game. I am a goal-oriented individual who delivers to productivity. I believe that learning is a progressive lifestyle as long as life and economy matters. My profound interest in machine learning and its various applications in industry has been my ultimate motivator of continuous studies and exploration. I am humble, committed, adaptable, discipline, hardworking, confident and above all respectful. 


Currently I am completing my MSc in Mathematical Sciences at [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences-AIMS Senegal](https://aims-senegal.org/). I focused on Big Data & Finance with Machine learning and Deep learning being the techniques and skills applied to various problem solving and projects. I am also a past student of the [University for Development Studies, UDS-Navrongo Campus-Ghana](https://nav.uds.edu.gh/) which is currently the [C.K. Tedam University of Technology and Applied Sciences](https://cktutas.edu.gh/) where I had my Bachelors degree in Financial Mathematics and a research on [capital structure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp). 

I am currently leveraging Machine learning and Deep learning skills in the applications of Finance, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I am passionate about data science related research and the study of mathematical models. I am on the verge of a climax of my thesis titled "Structural approach to credit risk modeling" supervise by [Dr. Conall Kelly](http://research.ucc.ie/profiles/D019/conall.kelly@ucc.ie). In this project we apply stochastic models of a companyâ€™s value to investigate the likelihood credit default events where the value of the company falls below the level of bankruptcy. We will consider exact solutions using the models of Merton and Black-Cox, as well as the role of simulation in generalising this framework outside of those models. 

My daily activities involve researching, learning and creating of new materials that help improve my skills and studies. On my [Github](https://github.com/IkeKobby) I have a few materials of my day to day activities in the respective repositories which are often updated as and when the need arises. 

I am available for collaboration on projects that relate to my areas of interest mentioned above. However, I am curious to apply my skills in any field as long as the problem is addressable and interpretable in the machine learning and deep learning world.
