I'm Isaac Kobby Anni, a Ghanaian by birth who enjoys playing table tennis. I am a goal-oriented individual who produces results. As long as life and economics are important, I feel that learning is a progressive lifestyle. My deep fascination with machine learning and its diverse applications in industry has been the driving force behind my ongoing research and discovery. I am humble, dedicated, adaptive, disciplined, diligent, self-assured, and most importantly, respectful. . 


At the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences-AIMS Senegal](https://aims-senegal.org/), I am now completing my thesis for an MSc in Mathematical Sciences.
I concentrated on Big Data and Finance, using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques and talents to solve problems and complete projects. I was also a former student of the [University for Development Studies, UDS-Navrongo Campus-Ghana](https://nav.uds.edu.gh/), which is now the [C.K. Tedam University of Technology and Applied Sciences](https://cktutas.edu.gh/), where I received my Bachelors degree in Financial Mathematics and completed a research project on [capital structure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp).

I'm now applying my machine learning and deep learning talents to finance, natural language processing, and computer vision applications. Data science research and the study of mathematical models are two areas in which I am very interested. My thesis, "Structural approach to credit risk modeling," is nearing completion under the supervision of [Dr. Conall Kelly](http://research.ucc.ie/profiles/D019/conall.kelly@ucc.ie). We use stochastic models of a company's value to study the possibility of credit default occurrences where the company's worth falls below the level of bankruptcy in this research. We'll look at exact solutions utilizing Merton and Black-Cox models, as well as how simulation might help us generalize this framework beyond those models.  

My daily activities include conducting research, learning, and developing new resources to aid in the development of my abilities and studies. I have a few items from my day-to-day activities in my [Github](https://github.com/IkeKobby) repositories, which are frequently updated as and when the necessity arises.

I am open to working on projects that are related to my areas of interest, which are listed below. However, I am interested in applying my talents in any industry where the problem may be addressed and interpreted using machine learning and deep learning.
