For more details on some of the works that are it yet on this blog visit [here](https://github.com/IkeKobby/). In this field of Data Science, I believe we can all become the versions of ourselves by holding on to the right resources. I will share a few of the most popular online resources that would be of great help to you. Every Data Scientist is also a googler, a problem solver and hence the need for reliable resources to help ease your sweat.

The tables below should give you some quick online sources to run to for various solutions;
